# Snake Charmer

A cookiecutter template for Python projects.

## Usage

After [installing `cookiecutter` itself](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html), get started with `snake-charmer` via:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/Nicholas-Autio-Mitchell/snake-charmer.git
```

## Details

Apart from automating naming, authorship etc. it contains options to specify:

* the Python version
* `.github` configuration files for CI via Git Actions
* PR and issue templates
* Unit tests directory and optionally `pytest` usage
* a `requirements.txt`
* Formatting and type-checking
* CLI package choices
* LICENSE file variants

It also provides a sensible `pyproject.toml` configuration for production grade Python.
